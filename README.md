# Webpack Base Project
A basic code for a project in TypeScript and Sass.

This template uses [Webpack Config Generator](https://github.com/MorganCaron/webpack-config-generator) to facilitate the configuration part.

## Development
In this mode, if one of your files is updated, the code will be recompiled so you don't have to run the full build manually.
`npm run dev`
or
`npm run watch`

## Production
In this mode, the files will be generated in the `/build` directory and automatically included in the index.html file.
`npm run prod`
or
`npm run build`
